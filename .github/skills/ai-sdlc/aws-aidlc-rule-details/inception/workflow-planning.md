# Workflow Planning

**Purpose**: Determine which phases to execute and create comprehensive execution plan

**Always Execute**: This phase always runs after understanding requirements and scope

## Step 1: Load All Prior Context

### 1.1 Load Reverse Engineering Artifacts (if brownfield)
- architecture.md
- component-inventory.md
- technology-stack.md
- dependencies.md

### 1.2 Load Requirements Analysis
- requirements.md (includes intent analysis)
- requirement-verification-questions.md (with answers)

### 1.3 Load User Stories (if executed)
- stories.md
- personas.md

## Step 2: Detailed Scope and Impact Analysis

**Now that we have complete context (requirements + stories), perform detailed analysis:**

### 2.1 Transformation Scope Detection (Brownfield Only)

**IF brownfield project**, analyze transformation scope:

#### Architectural Transformation
- **Single component change** vs **architectural transformation**
- **Infrastructure changes** vs **application changes**
- **Deployment model changes** (Lambda→Container, EC2→Serverless, etc.)

#### Related Component Identification
For transformations, identify:
- **Infrastructure code** that needs updates
- **CDK stacks** requiring changes
- **API Gateway** configurations
- **Load balancer** requirements
- **Networking** changes needed
- **Monitoring/logging** adaptations

#### Cross-Package Impact
- **CDK infrastructure** packages requiring updates
- **Shared models** needing version updates
- **Client libraries** requiring endpoint changes
- **Test packages** needing new test scenarios

### 2.2 Change Impact Assessment

#### Impact Areas
1. **User-facing changes**: Does this affect user experience?
2. **Structural changes**: Does this change system architecture?
3. **Data model changes**: Does this affect database schemas or data structures?
4. **API changes**: Does this affect interfaces or contracts?
5. **NFR impact**: Does this affect performance, security, or scalability?

#### Application Layer Impact (if applicable)
- **Code changes**: New entry points, adapters, configurations
- **Dependencies**: New libraries, framework changes
- **Configuration**: Environment variables, config files
- **Testing**: Unit tests, integration tests

#### Infrastructure Layer Impact (if applicable)
- **Deployment model**: Lambda→ECS, EC2→Fargate, etc.
- **Networking**: VPC, security groups, load balancers
- **Storage**: Persistent volumes, shared storage
- **Scaling**: Auto-scaling policies, capacity planning

#### Operations Layer Impact (if applicable)
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch, custom metrics, dashboards
- **Logging**: Log aggregation, structured logging
- **Alerting**: Alarm configurations, notification channels
- **Deployment**: CI/CD pipeline changes, rollback strategies

### 2.3 Component Relationship Mapping (Brownfield Only)

**IF brownfield project**, create component dependency graph:

```markdown
## Component Relationships
- **Primary Component**: [Package being changed]
- **Infrastructure Components**: [CDK/Terraform packages]
- **Shared Components**: [Models, utilities, clients]
- **Dependent Components**: [Services that call this component]
- **Supporting Components**: [Monitoring, logging, deployment]
```

For each related component:
- **Change Type**: Major, Minor, Configuration-only
- **Change Reason**: Direct dependency, deployment model, networking
- **Change Priority**: Critical, Important, Optional

### 2.4 Risk Assessment

Evaluate risk level:
1. **Low**: Isolated change, easy rollback, well-understood
2. **Medium**: Multiple components, moderate rollback, some unknowns
3. **High**: System-wide impact, complex rollback, significant unknowns
4. **Critical**: Production-critical, difficult rollback, high uncertainty

## Step 3: Phase Determination

### 3.1 User Stories - Already Executed or Skip?
**Already executed**: Move to next determination
**Not executed - Execute IF**:
- Multiple user personas
- User experience impact
- Acceptance criteria needed
- Team collaboration required

**Skip IF**:
- Internal refactoring
- Bug fix with clear reproduction
- Technical debt reduction
- Infrastructure changes

### 3.2 Application Design - Execute IF:
- New components or services needed
- Component methods and business rules need definition
- Service layer design required
- Component dependencies need clarification

**Skip IF**:
- Changes within existing component boundaries
- No new components or methods
- Pure implementation changes

### 3.3 Design (Units Planning/Generation) - Execute IF:
- New data models or schemas
- API changes or new endpoints
- Complex algorithms or business logic
- State management changes
- Multiple packages require changes
- Infrastructure-as-code updates needed

**Skip IF**:
- Simple logic changes
- UI-only changes
- Configuration updates
- Straightforward implementations

### 3.4 NFR Implementation - Execute IF:
- Performance requirements
- Security considerations
- Scalability concerns
- Monitoring/observability needed

**Skip IF**:
- Existing NFR setup sufficient
- No new NFR requirements
- Simple changes with no NFR impact

## Step 4: Note Adaptive Detail

**See [depth-levels.md](../common/depth-levels.md) for adaptive depth explanation**

For each stage that will execute:
- All defined artifacts will be created
- Detail level within artifacts adapts to problem complexity
- Model determines appropriate detail based on problem characteristics

## Step 5: Multi-Module Coordination Analysis (Brownfield Only)

**IF brownfield with multiple modules/packages**, analyze dependencies and determine optimal update strategy:

### 5.1 Analyze Module Dependencies
- Examine build system dependencies and dependency manifests
- Identify build-time vs runtime dependencies
- Map API contracts and shared interfaces between modules

### 5.2 Determine Update Strategy
Based on dependency analysis, decide:
- **Update sequence**: Which modules must be updated first due to dependencies
- **Parallelization opportunities**: Which modules can be updated simultaneously
- **Coordination requirements**: Version compatibility, API contracts, deployment order
- **Testing strategy**: Per-module vs integrated testing approach
- **Rollback strategy**: Recovery plan if mid-sequence failures occur

### 5.3 Document Coordination Plan
```markdown
## Module Update Strategy
- **Update Approach**: [Sequential/Parallel/Hybrid]
- **Critical Path**: [Modules that block other updates]
- **Coordination Points**: [Shared APIs, infrastructure, data contracts]
- **Testing Checkpoints**: [When to validate integration]
```

Identify for each affected module:
- **Update priority**: Must-update-first vs can-update-later
- **Dependency constraints**: What it depends on, what depends on it
- **Change scope**: Major (breaking), Minor (compatible), Patch (fixes)

## Step 6: Generate Workflow Visualization

Create Mermaid flowchart showing:
- All phases in sequence
- EXECUTE or SKIP decision for each conditional phase
- Proper styling for each phase state

**Styling rules** (add after flowchart):
```
style WD fill:#4CAF50,stroke:#1B5E20,stroke-width:3px,color:#fff
style CP fill:#4CAF50,stroke:#1B5E20,stroke-width:3px,color:#fff
style CG fill:#4CAF50,stroke:#1B5E20,stroke-width:3px,color:#fff
style BT fill:#4CAF50,stroke:#1B5E20,stroke-width:3px,color:#fff
style US fill:#BDBDBD,stroke:#424242,stroke-width:2px,stroke-dasharray: 5 5,color:#000
style Start fill:#CE93D8,stroke:#6A1B9A,stroke-width:3px,color:#000
style End fill:#CE93D8,stroke:#6A1B9A,stroke-width:3px,color:#000

linkStyle default stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

**Style Guidelines**:
- Completed/Always execute: `fill:#4CAF50,stroke:#1B5E20,stroke-width:3px,color:#fff` (Material Green with white text)
- Conditional EXECUTE: `fill:#FFA726,stroke:#E65100,stroke-width:3px,stroke-dasharray: 5 5,color:#000` (Material Orange with black text)
- Conditional SKIP: `fill:#BDBDBD,stroke:#424242,stroke-width:2px,stroke-dasharray: 5 5,color:#000` (Material Gray with black text)
- Start/End: `fill:#CE93D8,stroke:#6A1B9A,stroke-width:3px,color:#000` (Material Purple with black text)
- Phase containers: Use lighter Material colors (INCEPTION: #BBDEFB, CONSTRUCTION: #C8E6C9, OPERATIONS: #FFF59D)

## Step 7: Create Execution Plan Document

Create `aidlc-docs/inception/plans/execution-plan.md`:

```markdown
