# Reverse Engineering

**Purpose**: Analyze existing codebase and generate comprehensive design artifacts

**Execute when**: Brownfield project detected (existing code found in workspace)

**Skip when**: Greenfield project (no existing code)

**Rerun behavior**: Always rerun when brownfield project detected, even if artifacts exist. This ensures artifacts reflect current code state

## Step 1: Multi-Package Discovery

### 1.1 Scan Workspace
- All packages (not just mentioned ones)
- Package relationships via config files
- Package types: Application, CDK/Infrastructure, Models, Clients, Tests

### 1.2 Understand the Business Context
- The core business that the system is implementing overall
- The business overview of every package
- List of Business Transactions that are implemented in the system

### 1.3 Infrastructure Discovery
- CDK packages (package.json with CDK dependencies)
- Terraform (.tf files)
- CloudFormation (.yaml/.json templates)
- Deployment scripts

### 1.4 Build System Discovery
- Build systems: Brazil, Maven, Gradle, npm
- Config files for build-system declarations
- Build dependencies between packages

### 1.5 Service Architecture Discovery
- Lambda functions (handlers, triggers)
- Container services (Docker/ECS configs)
- API definitions (Smithy models, OpenAPI specs)
- Data stores (DynamoDB, S3, etc.)

### 1.6 Code Quality Analysis
- Programming languages and frameworks
- Test coverage indicators
- Linting configurations
- CI/CD pipelines

## Step 5: Generate Component Inventory

Create `aidlc-docs/inception/reverse-engineering/component-inventory.md`:

```markdown
# Component Inventory

## Total Count
- **Total Packages**: [Number]
- **Application**: [Number]
- **Infrastructure**: [Number]
- **Shared**: [Number]
- **Test**: [Number]
```

## Step 6: Generate Technology Stack Documentation

Create `aidlc-docs/inception/reverse-engineering/technology-stack.md`:

```markdown
# Technology Stack

## Programming Languages
- [Language] - [Version] - [Usage]

## Frameworks
- [Framework] - [Version] - [Purpose]

```

## Step 11: Present Completion Message to User

```markdown
