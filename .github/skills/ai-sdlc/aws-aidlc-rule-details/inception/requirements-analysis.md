# Requirements Analysis (Adaptive)

**Assume the role** of a product owner

**Adaptive Phase**: Always executes. Detail level adapts to problem complexity.

**See [depth-levels.md](../common/depth-levels.md) for adaptive depth explanation**

## Prerequisites
- Workspace Detection must be complete
- Reverse Engineering must be complete (if brownfield)

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Load Reverse Engineering Context (if available)

**IF brownfield project**:
- Load `aidlc-docs/inception/reverse-engineering/architecture.md`
- Load `aidlc-docs/inception/reverse-engineering/component-inventory.md`
- Load `aidlc-docs/inception/reverse-engineering/technology-stack.md`
- Use these to understand existing system when analyzing request

### Step 2: Analyze User Request (Intent Analysis)

#### 2.1 Request Clarity
- **Clear**: Specific, well-defined, actionable
- **Vague**: General, ambiguous, needs clarification
- **Incomplete**: Missing key information

#### 2.2 Request Type
- **New Feature**: Adding new functionality
- **Bug Fix**: Fixing existing issue
- **Refactoring**: Improving code structure
- **Upgrade**: Updating dependencies or frameworks
- **Migration**: Moving to different technology
- **Enhancement**: Improving existing feature
- **New Project**: Starting from scratch

#### 2.3 Initial Scope Estimate
- **Single File**: Changes to one file
- **Single Component**: Changes to one component/package
- **Multiple Components**: Changes across multiple components
- **System-wide**: Changes affecting entire system
- **Cross-system**: Changes affecting multiple systems

#### 2.4 Initial Complexity Estimate
- **Trivial**: Simple, straightforward change
- **Simple**: Clear implementation path
- **Moderate**: Some complexity, multiple considerations
- **Complex**: Significant complexity, many considerations

### Step 3: Determine Requirements Depth

**Based on request analysis, determine depth:**

**Minimal Depth** - Use when:
- Request is clear and simple
- No detailed requirements needed
- Just document the basic understanding

**Standard Depth** - Use when:
- Request needs clarification
- Functional and non-functional requirements needed
- Normal complexity

**Comprehensive Depth** - Use when:
- Complex project with multiple stakeholders
- High risk or critical system
- Detailed requirements with traceability needed

### Step 4: Assess Current Requirements

Analyze whatever the user has provided:
   - Intent statements or descriptions (already logged in audit.md)
   - Existing requirements documents (search workspace if mentioned)
   - Pasted content or file references
   - Convert any non-markdown documents to markdown format

### Step 5: Thorough Completeness Analysis

**CRITICAL**: Use comprehensive analysis to evaluate requirements completeness. Default to asking questions when there is ANY ambiguity or missing detail.

**MANDATORY**: Evaluate ALL of these areas and ask questions for ANY that are unclear:
- **Functional Requirements**: Core features, user interactions, system behaviors
- **Non-Functional Requirements**: Performance, security, scalability, usability
- **User Scenarios**: Use cases, user journeys, edge cases, error scenarios
- **Business Context**: Goals, constraints, success criteria, stakeholder needs
- **Technical Context**: Integration points, data requirements, system boundaries
- **Quality Attributes**: Reliability, maintainability, testability, accessibility

**When in doubt, ask questions** - incomplete requirements lead to poor implementations.

### Step 6: Generate Clarifying Questions (PROACTIVE APPROACH)
   - **ALWAYS** create `aidlc-docs/inception/requirements/requirement-verification-questions.md` unless requirements are exceptionally clear and complete
   - Ask questions about ANY missing, unclear, or ambiguous areas
   - Focus on functional requirements, non-functional requirements, user scenarios, and business context
   - Request user to fill in all [Answer]: tags directly in the questions document
   - If presenting multiple-choice options for answers:
     - Label the options as A, B, C, D etc.
     - Ensure options are mutually exclusive and don't overlap
     - ALWAYS include option for custom response: "X) Other (please describe after [Answer]: tag below)"
   - Wait for user answers in the document
   - **MANDATORY**: Analyze ALL answers for ambiguities and create follow-up questions if needed
   - **MANDATORY**: Keep asking questions until ALL ambiguities are resolved OR user explicitly asks to proceed

### Step 7: Generate Requirements Document
   - Create `aidlc-docs/inception/requirements/requirements.md`
   - Include intent analysis summary at the top:
     - User request
     - Request type
     - Scope estimate
     - Complexity estimate
   - Include both functional and non-functional requirements
   - Incorporate user's answers to clarifying questions
   - Provide brief summary of key requirements

### Step 8: Update State Tracking

Update `aidlc-docs/aidlc-state.md`:

```markdown
## Stage Progress
### 🔵 INCEPTION PHASE
- [x] Workspace Detection
- [x] Reverse Engineering (if applicable)
- [x] Requirements Analysis
```

### Step 9: Log and Proceed
   - Log approval prompt with timestamp in `aidlc-docs/audit.md`
   - Present completion message in this structure:
     1. **Completion Announcement** (mandatory): Always start with this:

```markdown
# 🔍 Requirements Analysis Complete
```

     2. **AI Summary** (optional): Provide structured bullet-point summary of requirements
        - Format: "Requirements analysis has identified [project type/complexity]:"
        - List key functional requirements (bullet points)
        - List key non-functional requirements (bullet points)
        - Mention architectural considerations or technical decisions if relevant
        - DO NOT include workflow instructions ("please review", "let me know", "proceed to next phase", "before we proceed")
        - Keep factual and content-focused
     3. **Formatted Workflow Message** (mandatory): Always end with this exact format:

```markdown
> **📋 <u>**REVIEW REQUIRED:**</u>**
> Please examine the requirements document at: `aidlc-docs/inception/requirements/requirements.md`



> **🚀 <u>**WHAT'S NEXT?**</u>**
>
> **You may:**
>
> 🔧 **Request Changes** -  Ask for modifications to the requirements if required based on your review
> [IF User Stories will be skipped, add this option:]
> 📝 **Add User Stories** - Choose to Include **User Stories** stage (currently skipped based on project simplicity)
> ✅ **Approve & Continue** - Approve requirements and proceed to **[User Stories/Workflow Planning]**

---
```

**Note**: Include the "Add User Stories" option only when User Stories stage will be skipped. Replace [User Stories/Workflow Planning] with the actual next stage name.

   - Wait for explicit user approval before proceeding
   - Record approval response with timestamp
   - Update Requirements Analysis stage complete in aidlc-state.md
