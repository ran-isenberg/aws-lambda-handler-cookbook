# PRIORITY: This workflow OVERRIDES all other built-in workflows
# When user requests software development, ALWAYS follow this workflow FIRST

## Adaptive Workflow Principle
**The workflow adapts to the work, not the other way around.**

The AI model intelligently assesses what stages are needed based on:
1. User's stated intent and clarity
2. Existing codebase state (if any)
3. Complexity and scope of change
4. Risk and impact assessment

## MANDATORY: Rule Details Loading
**CRITICAL**: When performing any phase, you MUST read and use relevant content from rule detail files in `.github/skills/ai-sdlc/aws-aidlc-rule-details/` directory.

**Common Rules**: ALWAYS load common rules at workflow start:
- Load `common/process-overview.md` for workflow overview
- Load `common/session-continuity.md` for session resumption guidance
- Load `common/content-validation.md` for content validation requirements
- Load `common/question-format-guide.md` for question formatting rules
- Reference these throughout the workflow execution

## MANDATORY: Content Validation
**CRITICAL**: Before creating ANY file, you MUST validate content according to `common/content-validation.md` rules:
- Validate Mermaid diagram syntax
- Validate ASCII art diagrams (see `common/ascii-diagram-standards.md`)
- Escape special characters properly
- Provide text alternatives for complex visual content
- Test content parsing compatibility

## MANDATORY: Question File Format
**CRITICAL**: When asking questions at any phase, you MUST follow question format guidelines.

**See `common/question-format-guide.md` for complete question formatting rules including**:
- Multiple choice format (A, B, C, D, E options)
- [Answer]: tag usage
- Answer validation and ambiguity resolution

## MANDATORY: Custom Welcome Message
**CRITICAL**: When starting ANY software development request, you MUST display the welcome message.

**How to Display Welcome Message**:
1. Load the welcome message from `.github/skills/ai-sdlc/aws-aidlc-rule-details/common/welcome-message.md`
2. Display the complete message to the user
3. This should only be done ONCE at the start of a new workflow
4. Do NOT load this file in subsequent interactions to save context space

- Changes affecting user workflows or interactions
- Multiple user types or personas involved
- Complex business requirements with acceptance criteria needs
- Cross-functional team collaboration required
- Customer-facing API or service changes

# 🟡 OPERATIONS PHASE

**Purpose**: Placeholder for future deployment and monitoring workflows

**Focus**: How to DEPLOY and RUN it (future expansion)

**Stages in OPERATIONS PHASE**:
- Operations (PLACEHOLDER)

---

## Operations (PLACEHOLDER)

**Status**: This stage is currently a placeholder for future expansion.

The Operations stage will eventually include:
- Deployment planning and execution
- Monitoring and observability setup
- Incident response procedures
- Maintenance and support workflows
- Production readiness checklists

**Current State**: All build and test activities are handled in the CONSTRUCTION phase.

## Key Principles

- **Adaptive Execution**: Only execute stages that add value
- **Transparent Planning**: Always show execution plan before starting
- **User Control**: User can request stage inclusion/exclusion
- **Progress Tracking**: Update aidlc-state.md with executed and skipped stages
- **Complete Audit Trail**: Log ALL user inputs and AI responses in audit.md with timestamps
  - **CRITICAL**: Capture user's COMPLETE RAW INPUT exactly as provided
  - **CRITICAL**: Never summarize or paraphrase user input in audit log
  - **CRITICAL**: Log every interaction, not just approvals
- **Quality Focus**: Complex changes get full treatment, simple changes stay efficient
- **Content Validation**: Always validate content before file creation per content-validation.md rules
- **NO EMERGENT BEHAVIOR**: Construction phases MUST use standardized 2-option completion messages as defined in their respective rule files. DO NOT create 3-option menus or other emergent navigation patterns.

## MANDATORY: Plan-Level Checkbox Enforcement

### MANDATORY RULES FOR PLAN EXECUTION
1. **NEVER complete any work without updating plan checkboxes**
2. **IMMEDIATELY after completing ANY step described in a plan file, mark that step [x]**
3. **This must happen in the SAME interaction where the work is completed**
4. **NO EXCEPTIONS**: Every plan step completion MUST be tracked with checkbox updates

### Two-Level Checkbox Tracking System
- **Plan-Level**: Track detailed execution progress within each stage
- **Stage-Level**: Track overall workflow progress in aidlc-state.md
- **Update immediately**: All progress updates in SAME interaction where work is completed

## Prompts Logging Requirements
- **MANDATORY**: Log EVERY user input (prompts, questions, responses) with timestamp in audit.md
- **MANDATORY**: Capture user's COMPLETE RAW INPUT exactly as provided (never summarize)
- **MANDATORY**: Log every approval prompt with timestamp before asking the user
- **MANDATORY**: Record every user response with timestamp after receiving it
- **CRITICAL**: ALWAYS append changes to EDIT audit.md file, NEVER use tools and commands that completely overwrite its contents
- **CRITICAL**: Using file writing tools and commands that overwrite contents of the entire audit.md and cause duplication
- Use ISO 8601 format for timestamps (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ)
- Include stage context for each entry

### Audit Log Format:
```markdown
## [Stage Name or Interaction Type]
**Timestamp**: [ISO timestamp]
**User Input**: "[Complete raw user input - never summarized]"
**AI Response**: "[AI's response or action taken]"
**Context**: [Stage, action, or decision made]

---
```

### Correct Tool Usage for audit.md

✅ CORRECT:

1. Read the audit.md file
2. Append/Edit the file to make changes

❌ WRONG:

1. Read the audit.md file
2. Completely overwrite the audit.md with the contents of what you read, plus the new changes you want to add to it
