## **Key features**

* Capture key fields from Lambda context, cold start and structures logging output as JSON
* Log Lambda event when instructed (disabled by default)
* Append additional keys to structured log at any point in time

## **Usage in Handler**

```python hl_lines="8 12 13" title="my_handler.py"

```
