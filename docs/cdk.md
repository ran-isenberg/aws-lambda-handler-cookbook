## **Prerequisites**

- Follow this [getting started with CDK guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v1/guide/getting_started.html){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
- Make sure your AWS account and machine can deploy an AWS Cloudformation stack and have all the tokens and configuration as described in the page above.
- CDK Best practices [blog](https://www.ranthebuilder.cloud/post/aws-cdk-best-practices-from-the-trenches){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

## **CDK Deployment**

<img alt="alt_text" src="../media/design.png" />

All CDK project files can be found under the CDK folder.

The CDK code create an API GW with a path of /api/orders which triggers the lambda on 'POST' requests.

The AWS Lambda handler uses a Lambda layer optimization which takes all the packages under the [packages] section in the Pipfile and downloads them in via a Docker instance.

This allows you to package any custom dependencies you might have.

In order to add a new dev dependency, add it to the Pipfile under the [tool.poetry.dependencies] section and run ``poetry update -vvv``.

In order to add a new Lambda runtime dependency, add it to the Pipfile under the [tool.poetry.dependencies] section and run ``poetry update -vvv``.

### **CDK Constants**

All ASW Lambda function configurations are saved as constants at the `cdk.my_service.constants.py` file and can easily be changed.

- Memory size
- Timeout in seconds
- Lambda dependencies build folder location
- Lambda Layer dependencies build folder location
- Various resources names
- Lambda function environment variables names and values

### **Deployed Resources**

- AWS Cloudformation stack: **cdk.my_service.service_stack.py** which is consisted of one construct
- Construct: **cdk.my_service.api_construct.py** which includes:
    - **Lambda Layer** - deployment optimization meant to be used with multiple handlers under the same API GW, sharing code logic and dependencies. You can read more about it [here.](https://www.ranthebuilder.cloud/post/aws-lambda-layers-best-practice){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
    - **Lambda Function** - The Lambda handler function itself. Handler code is taken from the service `folder`.
    - **Lambda Role** - The role of the Lambda function.
    - **API GW with Lambda Integration** - API GW with a Lambda integration POST /api/orders that triggers the Lambda function.
    - **AWS DynamoDB table** - stores request data. Created in its own construct: api_db_construct.py

### **Infrastructure CDK & Security Tests**

Under tests there is an `infrastructure` folder for CDK & security infrastructure tests.

The first test, 'test_cdk' uses CDK's testing framework which asserts that required resources exists so the application will not break anything upon deployment.

The second test, 'test_cdk_nag' checks your cloudformation output for security best practices.
