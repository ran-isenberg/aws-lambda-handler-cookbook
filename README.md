This project provides a working, open source based, AWS Lambda handler skeleton Python code including DEPLOYMENT code with CDK and a pipeline.

This project can serve as a template for new Serverless services - CDK deployment code, pipeline and handler are covered.

## **The Problem**

Starting a Serverless service can be overwhelming. You need to figure out many questions and challenges that have nothing to do with your business domain:

- How to deploy to the cloud? What IAC framework do you choose?
- How to write a SaaS-oriented CI/CD pipeline? What does it need to contain?
- How do you handle observability, logging, tracing, metrics?
- How do you handle testing?
- What makes an AWS Lambda handler resilient, traceable, and easy to maintain? How do you write such a code?


## **The Solution**

This project aims to reduce cognitive load and answer these questions for you by providing a skeleton Python Serverless service template that implements best practices for AWS Lambda, Serverless CI/CD, and AWS CDK in one template project.

### Serverless Service - The Order service

- This project provides a working orders service where customers can create orders of items.

- The project deploys an API GW with an AWS Lambda integration under the path POST /api/orders/ and stores data in a DynamoDB table.

### **Features**

- Python Serverless service with a recommended file structure.
- CDK infrastructure with infrastructure tests and security tests.
- CI/CD pipelines based on Github actions that deploys to AWS with python linters, static code analysis, complexity checks and style formatters.
- The AWS Lambda handler embodies Serverless best practices and has all the bells and whistles for a proper production ready handler.
- AWS Lambda handler uses [AWS Lambda Powertools](https://awslabs.github.io/aws-lambda-powertools-python/).
- Unit, integration and E2E tests.


## CDK Deployment
The CDK code create an API GW with a path of /api/orders which triggers the lambda on 'POST' requests.

The AWS Lambda handler uses a Lambda layer optimization which takes all the packages under the [packages] section in the Pipfile and downloads them in via a Docker instance.

This allows you to package any custom dependencies you might have, just add them to the Pipfile under the [packages] section.

## Serverless Best Practices
The AWS Lambda handler will implement multiple best practice utilities.

Each utility is implemented when a new blog post is published about that utility.

The utilities cover multiple aspect of a production-ready service, including:

- [Logging](https://www.ranthebuilder.cloud/post/aws-lambda-cookbook-elevate-your-handler-s-code-part-1-logging)
- [Observability: Monitoring and Tracing](https://www.ranthebuilder.cloud/post/aws-lambda-cookbook-elevate-your-handler-s-code-part-2-observability)
- [Observability: Business KPIs Metrics](https://www.ranthebuilder.cloud/post/aws-lambda-cookbook-elevate-your-handler-s-code-part-3-business-domain-observability)
- [Environment Variables](https://www.ranthebuilder.cloud/post/aws-lambda-cookbook-environment-variables)
- [Input Validation](https://www.ranthebuilder.cloud/post/aws-lambda-cookbook-elevate-your-handler-s-code-part-5-input-validation)
